The current folder contains three agents.
These agents are NOT included in the experiments since they are simple versions of the agents playing in Arena for DEMO purposes. 
They do not have time constraints as the original agents used for experimentation.
If you want to run them, just run the file Demo.py from the parent folder.
The agents that we used for the experiments are under the folder called Agents.
