The current folder contains three folders for the experiments of the three different agents, and a folder for Results.
It is also contains a jupyter notebook called Results_Plots.ipynb which gathers all the results and visualize the plots.
In order to run any of the experiments you have to drag and drop the script you want to run, in the parent folder where the Arena.py exists.
All the experiments made in parallel-fashion using many cores on adamant in the DS-Lab of LIACS. 
We ran these experiments on heavy-computational machines. Do not run these scripts on a general-purpose machine. 
The scripts for mcs and mcts need more than 10 cores. The qlearning experiments need less.
